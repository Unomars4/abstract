Problems:
 - I'm having an issue solving this async issue when fetching data.
  - It's almost like the isn't being waited for. The synchronous code is running then isn't refreshing the when the data changes. It's frustrating me.


Possible Solutions:
 - Let's dedug by seeing if components are mounted before the data is set 
 -- Above is true

 - Create a kind of global state for charts to use without prop drilling. They should all use the same shared instance



Steps to Solution:
- At the root of a dashboard page, you create a single chart context.
 - This chart ctx takes in the url for the data fetching.
 - Getters for the data
 - Prop drill the chart ctx so other components can access it to.
